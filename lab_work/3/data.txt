Whispers of Winter

The world lies still beneath a frosty shroud,
A hush of silence, soft and proud.
The trees wear coats of crystal white,
Glistening jewels in pale moonlight.

Snowflakes dance in the evening glow,
Silent messengers from clouds below.
The air is crisp, the stars burn bright,
Winter's charm in the velvet night.

Though the cold may sting and the winds may moan,
There's warmth in hearts, a fire of our own.
For winter's tale is more than frost-
It's beauty found in what seems lost.
